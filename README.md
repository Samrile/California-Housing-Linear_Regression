# **California Housing Price Prediction Using Linear Regression**

This project implements a **Linear Regression Model** to predict housing prices based on various features such as median income, house age, and population density, using the **California Housing Dataset**. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation, making it a perfect beginner-friendly project for data science enthusiasts.

## **Overview**

Housing price prediction is a classic problem in data science. This project uses the California Housing dataset to:
- Explore the dataset through visualizations and statistical summaries.
- Perform feature selection based on correlation.
- Build a Linear Regression model to predict housing prices.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like RÂ², Mean Squared Error, and Mean Absolute Error.

This project serves as an introduction to **Machine Learning** concepts, focusing on regression analysis and model evaluation.

## **Dataset Description**

The **California Housing Dataset** contains information collected in the 1990 U.S. Census. The target variable is the median value of houses (`PRICE`), which is predicted based on features such as:
- `MedInc`: Median income in the area.
- `HouseAge`: Median age of the houses in the area.
- `AveRooms`: Average number of rooms per house.
- `AveOccup`: Average number of people per household.
- And more...

### Dataset Source:
The dataset is loaded from `scikit-learn` using `fetch_california_housing`.

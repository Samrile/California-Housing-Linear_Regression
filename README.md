Overview
Housing price prediction is a classic problem in data science. This project uses the California Housing dataset to:

Explore the dataset through visualizations and statistical summaries.
Perform feature selection based on correlation.
Build a Linear Regression model to predict housing prices.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like R², Mean Squared Error, and Mean Absolute Error.
This project serves as an introduction to Machine Learning concepts, focusing on regression analysis and model evaluation.

Dataset Description
The California Housing Dataset contains information collected in the 1990 U.S. Census. The target variable is the median value of houses (PRICE), which is predicted based on features such as:

MedInc: Median income in the area.
HouseAge: Median age of the houses in the area.
AveRooms: Average number of rooms per house.
AveOccup: Average number of people per household.
And more...
Dataset Source:
The dataset is loaded from scikit-learn using fetch_california_housing.

Project Workflow
The project follows these steps:

Data Loading:

The California Housing dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizations are created to understand the distribution of house prices and relationships between features.
Feature Selection:

Correlation analysis is performed to select the most relevant features for prediction.
Data Splitting:

The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
Model Training:

A Linear Regression model is trained on the selected features.
Model Evaluation:

Metrics such as R², Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are computed.
Residual analysis and scatter plots of actual vs predicted prices are generated.
Feature Importance:

Coefficients of the regression model are analyzed to determine the impact of each feature.
Results
Performance Metrics:

R² Score: Measures how well the model explains variability in house prices.
MSE: Average squared difference between actual and predicted prices.
MAE: Average absolute difference between actual and predicted prices.
Visual Insights:

Scatter plot showing the relationship between actual and predicted prices.
Residual analysis to evaluate the distribution of errors.
Future Enhancements
Add support for advanced regression techniques (e.g., Ridge, Lasso).
Include cross-validation for robust model evaluation.
Explore hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model.
Deploy the model as a web application using Flask or Streamlit.
